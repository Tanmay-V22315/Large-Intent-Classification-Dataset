# Large-Intent-Classification-Dataset
A dataset with about 111,131 elements, includes Out-Of-Scope examples as well.

## How was this created?
I used [oos-eval](https://github.com/clinc/oos-eval) dataset and paraphrased every sentence using [Parrot](https://pythonrepo.com/repo/PrithivirajDamodaran-Parrot-python-natural-language-processing)

## Is this clean?
Unfortunately, no. I can't guarantee that every sentence matches up with its appropriate intent since I automated everything. Aside from that, some sentences have some punctuations while some don't. Also, you should note that since some sentences are the same as previous sentences but phrased in a different manner, this may cause some issues for you and the dataset is pretty imbalanced as well.
